Here are some ideas to get you started:

Hi, my name is Mingming Su. I'm a Ph.D. student in Department of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Ning Guo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/nguo). I major in Geotechnical Engineering.

My research areas include: deep learning, computational mechanics, numerical simulation, differentiable physics, etc. Specifically, I am particularly interested in data-driven computational mechanics, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), etc.
